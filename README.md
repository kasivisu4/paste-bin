# The Challenge - [Building Your Own Pastebin](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-pastebin/)
This challenge is to build your own version of a Pastebin. A pastebin is a text storage site that allows users to store plain text in order to share it with other people.

The most well known version is of course the eponymous pastebin.com.
